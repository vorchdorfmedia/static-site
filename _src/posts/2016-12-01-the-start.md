## The first post

Instead of an inital commit, this should rather be an initial post.  
The main purpose of this blog is a constant update of a worklog for my master thesis project.

In the end, it should feature a static site generator in an online service, automatically selecting only the most crucial files needed for a contemporary rebuild of information.

Currently, everything is right on the start, and I don't really know where to begin, without blocking any future work. I guess that's a dilemma every developer has to face one or more times during his work.
