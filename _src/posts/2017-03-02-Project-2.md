## Started Project 2

After a successful presentation of the first part of my Thesis Project, I took 2 weeks off to focus on side projects, as well as some other work.
Today I started working on the Thesis Project again. After some interesting talks with my supervisor, we made clear to shape this project as a backend-only solution, capable of triggering builds via HTTP requests.

### What's ahead

* Work on the selective approach.
* Dynamically include/execute a metalsmith instance containing necessary modules.
* Parse the project's config file.
* Minimize request time by separating parts of the build pipeline into threads.
