# First API interactions

Today I was able to create the first basic route parameters. Also, data persistence is now enabled using Mongoose and MongoDB.  
Further improvements were [GitHub](https://www.github.com) related issues concerning the API.

## Functions added

* Project creation and storage in DB
* Different checks for users/repos on GitHub

## Next steps

Next steps will be creating the building process, as well as a first implementation of diff handling.
